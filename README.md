# KNet
## Description
This network aims to better model two of the brain's core processes that are said to be critical to learning and cognition: plasticity and unsupervised learning. The network aims to do this by being a hybrid of Cascade Correlational Model which models plasticity, and an unsupervised neural network based on the wake sleep algorithm.

So far, our design has led us to having a wake-sleep network whose layers are CCNs with a variable number of nodes.

## Style Guide
We use the industry standard [PEP8].
